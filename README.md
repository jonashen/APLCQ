# APLCQ
Autonomous Precision Landing Control of Quadcopter

This branch contains the code used for implementation and testing of the Drone Communication/Flight Control subsystems, which eventually became the basis of the demo app.  While the DJI UILibrary forms the basis of the app, the new code mostly handles usage of virtual stick and reading sensor information, which is primarily contained in the DroneControl folder.
